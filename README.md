# ðŸ§­ KiloProject

### Phase 1  
Marks the beginning of my journey in **`desktop` and `Android` development**.  
Throughout this phase, I explored the fundamentals of building complete systems from **database to user interface** using `Java`, `Kotlin`, `JavaFX`, `Swing`, and `Firebase`.  

Each project focused on **clean architecture**, **responsive design**, and **practical functionality**, resulting in real-world applications such as restaurant and library management systems, a cloud-based notes app, and a live news & weather platform.  

This phase showcases my ability to **design, build, and connect every layer of an application** â€” from data handling to modern UI/UX.

> ### ðŸš€ Phase 2 is on the way!  
> Expanding into **web development**, **advanced Android concepts**, and **UI/UX refinement** â€” taking this journey even further.
