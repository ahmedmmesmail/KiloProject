# 🚀 KiloProject Phase 1

**KiloProject Phase 1** represents a complete journey through the fundamentals of **desktop** and **Android application development**.  
Across four distinct projects, I explored different technologies and architectures — from **JavaFX** and **Swing** for desktop systems to **Firebase** and **Kotlin (MVVM)** for modern Android apps.

Each project emphasizes **clean code**, **practical problem-solving**, and **user-centered design**, covering real-world use cases like restaurant and library management, note-taking, and live news & weather delivery.

## 🎯 Highlights

- 🧩 Design full systems from **database to UI**
- ⚙️ Work with a variety of **frameworks and technologies** across different domains
- 🔐 Implement **authentication**, **data persistence**, and **responsive interfaces**
- 🏗️ Follow **modern architectural patterns** for maintainability and scalability

> **KiloProject Phase 1** lays the foundation for upcoming phases that will explore web development, advanced Android concepts, and UI/UX refinement.
